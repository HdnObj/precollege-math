# Summary

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in pre-college math** using online materials.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in fundamental concepts
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

# Curriculum

Many OSSU students choose to review math topics that they have not studied recently.
OSSU recommends using [The College Prep School](https://www.youtube.com/@thecollegeprepschool4486/playlists) for such a review.
To determine where you should start, we recommend scanning through the Final Tests for anything you may be uncomfortable with. After taking an assessment, you should have a clear idea of what topics to study and where you should start with the resources below.

When going through the playlists, it's important to pause the video and complete most of the problems yourself. You don't have to complete all the problems since a few are used to demonstrate the solving technique, but try to complete as many as possible.
Practice what you have not mastered by:
1. Googling and/or searching [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) for another POV on the topic or more practice problems, working through the examples with them. [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/@khanacademy), [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOrganicChemistryTutor), & [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorLeonard) are great resources for this.


## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above,
you have completed all the prerequisite math necessary to begin a bachelor's degree.
Congratulations!

What is next for you? You can start with the OSSU [Computer Science](https://cs.ossu.dev), [Data Science](https://ds.ossu.dev), or [Math](https://math.ossu.dev/) curriculum.
